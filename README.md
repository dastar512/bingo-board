# The Silver Gauntlets bingo board

This is a fun little bingo board for special occasions over on
[The Silver Gauntlets](https://twitch.tv/thesilvergauntlets) Twitch channel.

Hosting this on Github Pages is still a big ol' TODO, but once it's ready, it will be available here:
https://tobiasgies.github.io/tsg-bingo-board/

This project is largely based on the work of [valiant-code](https://github.com/valiant-code). Thanks so much!
